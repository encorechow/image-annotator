# Multi-class Image Segmentation Annotator
This is a web application for custom multi-class annotation. The current applied algorithm in back-end is GrabCut. We may switch to other more efficient algorithms later, but for the sake of completion of the application, we will keep use GrabCut for the moment. There is also a manual mode for fine-tuning.


### Instructions

Since this is still incomplete, I haven't put an dependencies file into repo, which is necessary for running the flask back-end. But if you want to try it, you have to install following python dependencies:

- flask
- PIL
- openCV for python

I will keep updating this repo.
